## Characterization of Fault Dimensions in Piles with Neural Networks

## Abstract

The use of pile foundations is very usual in civil engineering. Between several tests,
the test of integrity of piles can guarantee the quality of this type of foundation. This
non-destructive test is popular due its low cost. The main problem of this test is that
their interpretation must be manually done by experienced experts in structural
dynamics. Since the number of piles to be tested can be very large and the time
required can be excessive then the use of artificial intelligence techniques can be very
convenient. In this work a technique based in artificial neural networks is proposed.
Although we show a specific application, the intention is to show the potential of
artificial intelligence techniques applied to civil engineering problems.
